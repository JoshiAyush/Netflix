## Questions

Please chat and ask questions on [Discussions][chat]! Jump in there and talk to us, and help others.

### Asking quality questions

Help us help you! Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it much easier for us to help.
Itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of asking something too specific when youâ€™re close to a problem. Then, those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional questions to understand what you are hoping to achieve. Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.

- Try to define what you need help with:
  - Is there something in particular you want to do?
  - What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  - Is there a concept youâ€™re not understanding?
- Search on GitHub to see if a similar question has been asked
- If possible, provide sample code
- The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you
